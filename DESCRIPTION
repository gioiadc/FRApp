Description: Analysis of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) 
  experiments using nonlinear mixed-effects regression models and analysis of 
  the results. FRApp is not limited to the analysis of FRAP experiments only. 
  Any nonlinear mixed-effects models with an asymptotic exponential functional 
  relationship to hierarchical data in various domains can be fitted. 
  The analysis of data available in the package is presented in Di Credico, G., 
  Pelucchi, S., Pauli, F. et al. (2025) <doi:10.1038/s41598-025-87154-w>.
